 NFL Data Analytics Project

Solving a few real world data related questions involving NFL data.
Data used was pulled from Kaggle, NFL.com, and Yahoo.com

Overview
This project is an analysis of NFL data from the past 10 years. The aim is to explore various statistical metrics related to team performance, player performance, and game outcomes to gain insights into the factors that contribute to success in the NFL.

Data Sources
The data used in this project was sourced from Pro Football Reference. The data includes information on game outcomes, team and player statistics, and individual player information.

Methodology
The data was cleaned and analyzed using Python and various libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The analysis focused on several key areas including:

Team performance metrics: such as win/loss record, offensive and defensive statistics, and point differentials.
Player performance metrics: such as passing, rushing, and receiving statistics for quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers.
Game outcomes: exploring the factors that contribute to winning or losing games, including turnovers, penalties, and time of possession.
Results
The analysis revealed several key insights, including:

The top performing teams consistently have strong offensive and defensive statistics, and maintain a positive point differential over the course of the season.
The most successful quarterbacks are those who are able to consistently make accurate passes and avoid turnovers.
Penalties and turnovers are key factors that contribute to losing games, regardless of other performance metrics.
Conclusion
Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to success in the NFL. The analysis can be used by coaches, players, and analysts to make data-driven decisions and improve performance on the field. The code and data used in this project are available in this repository, and can be easily replicated or built upon for further analysis.
